	<!--<p class="mec-abstract">In this paper, I quantify the extent to which lobbying expenditures by firms affect policy enactment. To achieve this end, I construct a novel dataset containing all federal energy legislation and lobbying activities by the energy sector during the 110th Congress. I then develop and estimate a game-theoretic model where heterogeneous players choose lobbying expenditures to affect the probability that a policy is enacted. I find that the effect of lobbying expenditures on a policy's equilibrium enactment probability to be statistically significant but very small. Nonetheless, the average returns from lobbying expenditures are estimated to be over 130 percent.</p> -->

	<!--<p class="mec-abstract">In government procurement auctions, eligibility requirements are often imposed and, perhaps not surprisingly, contracts generally have a small number of participating bidders. To understand the effects of the restrictions of competition on the total cost of government procurement, we develop, identify, and estimate a principal-agent model in which the government selects a contractor to undertake a project. We consider three reasons why restricting entry could be beneficial to the government: by decreasing bid processing and solicitation costs, by increasing the chance of selecting a favored contractor and consequently reaping benefits from the favored contractor, and by decreasing the expected amount of price to the winning contractor. When the participation is costly and bidders are heterogeneous, the expected amount of price to the winning contractor may decrease by excluding ex-ante less efficient contractors.  Using our estimates, we quantify the effects of the eligibility restrictions on the total cost of procurement.</p> -->

	<!--<p class="mec-abstract">Lobbying firms provide access to policymakers in the lobbying process, but little is known about how political access is allocated in this market and what role lobbyists play as intermediaries. To answer these questions, we analyze detailed lobbying contacts drawn from reports mandated by the Foreign Agent Registration Act. We find that when lobbying firms have multiple clients, the set of policymakers contacted on behalf of a particular client tends to vary with the identity of the client and the lobbying issue. Firms with connections to a politician are more likely to make contacts to that politician than those without connections. However, we find that lobbyists do not always contact the politicians with whom they have connections; the chance of making such contacts depends on the electoral cycle, the political sensitivity of the lobbying issue, and the type of clients. We find that lobbying firms charge a large premium when they make contacts to the politicians that they have connections with. We also find that there exists even a larger premium for contacts to connected politicians when the client is from an autocratic country with a relatively large US media spotlight during an election year. This additional premium, on the other hand, does not exist for contacts to politicians without connections. These findings suggest that connected lobbyists play an independent role as intermediaries in the market for access between their clients and policymakers.</p>-->
